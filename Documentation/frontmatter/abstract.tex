\begin{abstract}
This project proposes the development of a peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging system for mobile devices that uses Bluetooth technology, enabling users to exchange text messages without relying on internet connectivity or centralized servers. The main objective is to design and implement a mobile application that performs device discovery, secure pairing, direct message transmission, and user-friendly chat sessions through Bluetooth. The proposed work includes defining a communication architecture suitable for dynamic peer discovery, connection management, and message delivery (possibly supporting relay or multi-hop forwarding when multiple devices are present). The project will involve developing a prototype for Android, designing the user interface, and implementing the core communication logic. Upon completion, the expected outcome is a working prototype demonstrating the feasibility of offline, decentralized messaging over Bluetooth, along with an analysis of its performance in terms of reliability, latency, message delivery success, and limitations such as range and scalability. This work aims to offer a lightweight solution for local communication in environments where internet or cellular networks are unavailable, expensive, or unreliable.
